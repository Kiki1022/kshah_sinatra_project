    Welcome to Beautify Me. A web app for Makeup Artists to create and store their client's profile. 
    
    The framework for my Sinatra Project was made possible thanks to the Sinatra App Generator Corneal and includes the following:
        -HTML
        -CSS
        -Ruby
        -SQLITE3
        -Sinatra
        -ActiveRecord

    So..about my Sinatra CRUD project, I created this web application for Makeup Artists. With this tool, Makeup Artists can create client profiles. As a makeup artist myself, I can say this is much needed!!
        
        This is the information you can store for your clients(all are required to create new client object):
        -Client Name
        -Client Email Address
        -Client Event: 
            -Formal Affair
            -Photo Session
            -Day Look
            -Night Out.
        -Client Rate(will be provided by the makeup artist to client for makeup application)

To get started with the web application:
    -Run 'bundle install' in the terminal to install the gems required.
    -Enter 'shotgun' in the terminal to produce an http link to run the web application.
    -Click on or paste the http link in your browser.
    -You are now on my webpage! Once you Sign up/Log In you can:
        Create - create a new instance of a client object.
        Read - read a specific instance of a client object or read all of your client objects.
        Update - update an instance of your client object.
        Delete - delete an instance of your client object.
        
    Happy clienteling!
